Effective biomarkers are urgently needed in clinical settings for early diagnosis and better disease management for prostate cancer patients. We analyzed transcriptomics and metabolomics profiles jointly in the SPORE prostate cancer cohort and identified two prognostic multi-omics signatures with high statistical powers (signature1: EGLN3, succinate, trans-4-hydroxyprolin; signature2: IL6, SLC22A2, histamine). Surrogate gene signatures were also trained as a proxy of multi-omics signatures.
